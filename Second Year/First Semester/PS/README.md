## Probabilities And Statistics - Project

This is an application that illustrates a series of discrete and continuous distributions and how they can be
used in the calculation : for each distribution you can also select the parameter values
which define the distribution, illustrate graphically the density (respectively the mass function) and the distribution function,
calculate the probabilities of the type P (X ≤ a), P (X ≥ b) or P (a ≤ X ≤ b), for values of a and b
data and graphically illustrate the probability calculated by drawing the corresponding area.
