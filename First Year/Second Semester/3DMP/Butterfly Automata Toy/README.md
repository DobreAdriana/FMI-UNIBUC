**Automata Butterfly Toy**

The project that I chose is an ***Automata Butterfly Toy*** which flaps its wings and moves back and forth when the crank is turned. I chose this mechanism because it looked really interesting to make and I also love butterflies. 

**How it works and the components of the mechanism**

When you turn the crank, the wheels rotate periodically which causes the connecting rods to touch the wings and make the butterfly to flutter its wings . I divided the mechanism into the next components:
- the box
- the butterfly - which has 2 components: the left wing and the right wing
- the axe
- the handle
- wheels - which has 3 components: disk 1, disk 2 and disk 3
- connecting rods - which has 3 components: connecting rod 1, connecting rod 2 (which consists of the body of the butterfly and the connecting rod 2) and connecting rod 3

In order to make the mechanism to work properly, I added some joints. I added a revolute joint between the axe and the box to make the axe rotate, 3 slider joints between every connecting rod and the box to make the connecting rods move up and down and I also put 2 revolute joints between every wing and the body of butterfly to make the wings move. 

The handle is the component that you needed to power in order to see how the automata works, but I produced the movement of the mechanism using a Motion Study. So if you want to see how the mechanism works, you need to play the Motion Study named "Automata Butterfly Toy". 

**File types**

I uploaded the next file types:
- .f3d
- .stl
- .jpg

**Software**

I designed everything using Fusion 360. 

**Author**

I could not find the name of the author, but I got inspired from the next video I saw on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHzZjUK9BuQ .

**Current progress**

- I created an empty component for each part of my project.
- I made the box, the disks, the axe and also the handle.
- I made the connecting rods and I added some changes to the components created so far.
- I made the body of the butterfly, but I realised that it has to be connected to the connecting rod 2 so I modified it.
- I made the wings of the butterfly and I designed them.
- I added some joints to make the mechanism work.
- I created the motion study.
